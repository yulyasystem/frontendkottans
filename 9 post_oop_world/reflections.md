**DRY**
dont repeat yourself 

I undrestood it like we should reduce repetitions in code as much as possible. DRYness is achieved by good planning. Reduce complexity by dividing code into components.


**KISS** keep it simple stupid :kissing_closed_eyes:

We should strive to the simpliest way of doing something. Code must be written to be understandable even by children :)

**YAGNI** 
Reduce the number of components. You do not need to add potential functionality into code. 

It is intresting principle, but it is difficult to understand because I have not worked on big projects where importance of these principles may be seen.
