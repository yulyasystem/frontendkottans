To be honest, this task was interesting but hard to me, espessialy to do in short terms, but thanks  to it and reviewer :) I have learnt a lot of new info:

* It is bad practise to add element to DOM from loop, instead I can use `createDocumentFragment` or `template` 
* better to use `data-*` for custom attributes
* learn how to create animations with perspective
* `Element.closest()` return the closes ancestor of the current element
* ` function ({ target }){...}` instead of `target = event.target`
