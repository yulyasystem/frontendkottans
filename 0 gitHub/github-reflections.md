# GitHub 

I`ve completed GitHub Udacity course and extra meaterials and learned tons of important info. It was interesting and interactive compared to common reading. 

Git is powerful and convinient to use in pojects. I will use it! 

### Reflections 

Git stores its own files and history in project folder, so I need to initialize repository by `git init`
`git status` checks the state of each file in project, if something is untracked or ready to be commited, it will display

**Commit**
It is fundamental of Git. First time it was hard to understand differance between `git commit` and `git push` 
So the first one commit changes to local repo and the second to remote.
Being good code-writers  we should write nice commits messages to avoid missunderstandings.:+1:
*Staging area* I think it is related to good commits, since commits should have logically separated. 
Rule: *One commit per logical change*

**Branching** 
It was a little bit confusing thing about branching and MERGING and I tried to go deeper. (https://learngitbranching.js.org/) let me
fully understand this concept and now I realize it is powerful. Also when I am afraid of pushing and destroying something created by teammates or better me, it is a good idea
to use new branch :laughing: 
During learning branching I faced a lot of errors. Brr... Boring and confusing things happened, but **No pain -no gain!** :muscle:
`git checkout` to shift between branches. Using this command we also can recover previous version of our code to specify id of commit and full path to file
`git checkout id(3c45) path(kottans.js)`

**Remote repositories**
`git remote add orinig addres-is-here` connect local repo to remote
 main repo in git is called origin 
 `git clone adrres-is-here` clone existing repo to your computer 
 I`ve created kottans-frontend and clonned it to my machine using this command 
 
 **Pull request**
 I understand it like possibility to patricipate, make changes in someone code. For example, I want to suggest new version of code or correct typo and I will make pull request to ask author of code.
 Forking is interesting feature of GitHub and way of making pull request.
