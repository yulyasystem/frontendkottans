# HTML 
**Key point is tag**. Inside opened tag may be attributes like `href` or `src`. The `alt` attribute is very important for those who use screen readers

#CSS 
**Key point is selector**. It selects the HTML elements that you want to style.
**Ruleset:**
```
div(selector){
        font-size:15px;
        (here is declaration block)
}
```
there are *tag* selectors, *attribute* (class,id) selectors. 

**CSS Units** : absolute and relative. Relative are ems,viewport width(vw),viewport height(vh),and absolute ones are pixels, mm,inches, cm.

The info in the course was given clearly but very formally. I wanna dive deeper!

htmlAcadamy is so cute ^_^ 

the trickiest and boring thing for me are tables. `table` means table :) `tr` table row, `td` table data, cell inside row. To add colunmn it is necessary to add `td` in `tr` 

**CSS cascading and priority** When for 1 element more than 1 css-rules are applied, web-browser use priority:
1. style attribute
2. selector id
3. class selector 
4. selector with tag name

**Inheritance in CSS** part of styles inherits from parents to child. Inheritance work not for all propeties, for example,  height and widht, margin etc.

**Pseudo-classes** defines special state of element. 
`:first-child`, `:last-child` select particular child. I think it is very easy to use, insted of putting classes for each tag. `nth-child` select by position number. 

Course from HtmlAcadamy was particularized, and I tnink that it is right way to learn  something strongly with practice. Sometimes tasks was so sweet and interesting. Not all tasks were easy for me and helps to stay motivated. It is good base to dive into advanced themes in html/css.
