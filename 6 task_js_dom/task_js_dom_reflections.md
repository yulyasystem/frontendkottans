## DOM 
I understand Document Object Model like it shows relationships between elements on web page. It`s quite interesting theame cause we can directly interact with html and css within JS. It represents markups as nodes and ojects, so we can dynamicaly change the markup. Node interface is blueprint for methods and properties which every real node has.

`$0` refers to particular element

Every element has innerHTML property returns HTML content inside the element. outerHTML represents itself and its children 

`.addEventListener` listen for events and respond to them 
*event listener needs:*

* an event target - called target

* the type of event to listen for - type 

* function to run when the event occurs - called listener

What does suprise me?
if objects look ideantical, they do not equal. 
To remove listener it is necessary both add and remove functions have same properties.

Ohh, extreamly confusing topic is event phases. I have to dive deeper to understand it!!1

While doing by own little app I learnt a looot! I researched DOM and methods of JS. It is very interesting to create by myself, but pretty hard at first :(
