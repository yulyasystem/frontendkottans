## Object Oriented Js
I familiar with OOP principles from my university lessons,it can help oraganize code in more logical way.
ES6 does not require function statement for methods:
```
const cat ={
    say(){
        console.log("meow");
    },
    sleep(){

    }
}
```
__Assignment operator doesn not create copy of an object, it only assigns reference to it.__

All specific things of OOP-Js were new for me. I  have familirized with different methods of copying objects.
